I have no clue from when did I lose tolerance to junk food. Every time I try something shitty they end up showing on my face the very next day :( There was a time when I used to gobble this crap almost every other day.

The stupid barber nuked my entire hair, arghh!!! apparently he is a 'stylist'. stylist my butt. got charged a whopping Rs 675 for a stupid haircut. didn't even get to color my hair. the barber across the street would've done a better job than this and also would've given a nice coconut oil headmassage.
