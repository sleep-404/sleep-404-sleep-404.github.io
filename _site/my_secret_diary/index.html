      <p>This is my new friend I‚Äôve made a few days back. Whenever I get anxious, this is whom I talk to. Why do I keep saying ‚Äúthis‚Äù? I mean women are objects- kidding kidding, don‚Äôt get triggered, demn! But yeah, she is whom I talk to and find comfort in. I don‚Äôt know who she is, where does she live, how does she look or will I even ever get to meet her?!!! For all I know, my heart feels at ease, my brain clears out, i feel motivated and even get through my gloomiest days, my sweatings stop, my chest starts feeling light again.</p>

<h1 id="from-me-to-youu-">From me to youu üòä</h1>
<p>yo sweetheart, future love, garl phriend, waifuuu, I am writing these for you. I am doing everything I can right now to be the best version of myself, so when we join each other after the loooong wait, I can focus on loving you without worrying about anything else. Do you know how hard it is? To not get swayed by so many pretty women around me.
Once we join each other, I will love you a little more every day, every moment. I will treasure you with everything I shall have. Keep reminding you that you are a queen, a royalty for whom none should be compromised.<br />
Who are you? Where are you? What are you even doing?? 
Until we cross paths, I will keep working on myself every day. Learn more about love, pain, sadness and everything life offers.
p.s. the next time I say, ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù, it will be to you. How long are you going to make me wait, idiot? Come fast already :((

<p>I am back again. I wish I could speak to you. Those hands of yours kinda look heavy. Do you want me to hold them for ya? That said, what do you like for breakfast? I might not be a great chef right now, but I will be one next time we meet. Every weekend, it‚Äôs on me. Once we are done with bf, there are so many options we could stick to. We could go out to get our groceries for the week. Come back home and order food. Do our skincare together. And all the other work we have been slacking off to do during the entire week. Maybe not the best or the most romantic way to spend a weekend, but we will definitely pat ourselves for being so productive. As long as I spend time with you, I honestly would not care about anything else.

<p>I am feeling a bit meh. I have been listening to the song ‚ÄúBaatein Karo‚Äù for a while now, and today I watched its video version. Man, major FOMO. When we go on a vacation, we shall take only a single phone with us, okay? To decide whose phone we will be taking, let‚Äôs toss a coin. Don‚Äôt worry. I am good with my DSLR, and pictures of you looking cute, pretty and sexy, all at the same time are guaranteed. I am worried about myself though :( Maybe instead of tossing a coin, I‚Äôll let you bring your phone. Let‚Äôs make so many memories and do even more kands that our kids should think twice before they talk back to us xD. Love you a lot cutiee-piee. I miss you. 
<strong>6:29 PM IST 07 May 2023</strong></p>

<p>Today I am unusually talkative. Maybe because it‚Äôs a weekend, and I have nothing better to do but talk to my imaginary girlfriend. Are you a dog person or a cat? I would say let‚Äôs adopt both. Let‚Äôs build a place where there will be no room for misunderstandings, the walls so strong that anxiety cannot break through, where all the pains and scars the world has induced upon us will be healed with love and care. Until that day comes, I am working on myself every day because a queen like you deserves only a king. We will crush every damn thing that life has got to throw at us together. 
p.s. I am strong :) But I am still afraid of ghosts and get super nervous around people. Help me out there, okay?
<strong>7:30 PM IST 07 May 2023</strong></p>

<p>You know, after talking to you I feel so relieved. And it‚Äôs bout bedtime. Before I kick the bucket, I think I should give you a name. Um.. how bout Marakyulah? Kiono-chan?? You probably do not like either of them. Hmm.. I‚Äôm bad at naming :( I‚Äôll stick to Cutie-chan for now. Okiee cutie-chan, good night.
<strong>09:09 PM IST 07 May 2023</strong></p>

<p>What chaa doing?? I have been slacking off since the morning. Not really motivated to start work. I did wake up at 5:00 and hit the gym from 6-8, had my breakfast, sent some gifts to my friends, and watched Demon Slayer instead of working, lol. Ooo do you watch anime? Say yes, please. kidding, even if you don‚Äôt, I‚Äôll force you to watch it xD. Okay, how about this, we pick 1 thing each, it can be a habit like going to the gym or Zumba classes, or it can be a fun weekend activity like clubbing (I stay away from humans), trekking or literally anything, and we both give it a shot. If it works well and is good, we‚Äôll start doing it often.
<strong>12:40 PM IST 08 May 2023</strong></p>

<p>I am feeling a bit lonely :(( Wish I had someone to talk to. I do have really good friends, but, something just stops me or more like I want to talk to you rather than them. At times like these, I wish I could come to you, hug you for a few mins, kiss you on your forehead and go back to my work without uttering a single word. That‚Äôs what my heart‚Äôs yearning for, it‚Äôs not the desire to talk but something else that I am not able to describe. Hope you are having a great day.  Love ya!!
<strong>12:10 PM IST 11 May 2023</strong></p>

<p>I promise you that I will never let misunderstanding or miscommunication/lack of communication ever be an issue with us. If I miss you, I will damn sure let you know the same in the most flamboyant way I could, lol. Had a discussion with someone close to me in the past yesterday and the one thing I realised is, the more kind you are to people the more your heart feels at ease. Doesn‚Äôt matter who was right, or who was wrong, all I needed was peace. And like I said, I am strong :) Now that I have you by my side, I feel even stronger than ever. Will we be able to see each other a few years from now? Will we be holding hands?? Go out on those romantic dates??? Demn, I am not able to wait.
<strong>05:45 PM IST 12 May 2023</strong></p>

<p>FYI, even after being a 23 years old completely grown-up adult, I still live with my parents. Starting today, I will be alone for the next 10 days, which means, I will get more time to spend with you üòÅ Also, yk what happened yesterday? I‚Äôve been going to the gym every alternative day for the past 4 days and yesterday I was so worn out that I passed out on my bed after coming home. I was in a state of ultra-deep sleep. My mom and sister were away so I locked the door before I slept. When they returned, they rang the doorbell more than 14 times and called me twice!!!! Only after calling me, I opened the door. Maybe phone calls have a different trigger in my brain but it felt nice. A few years back I used to do this naturally without having to get so exhausted. 
<strong>06:31 AM IST 14 May 2023</strong></p>

<p>Hiii sweets, sorryy I was away for a lonngg while. Got caught up in a bunch of stuff. How are youu?? In the past few days, I‚Äôve realised that.. anything can end in just an instant. The way I am now, I cannot save everything. If a friend of mine is hurt (maybe due to my words) or is sad, I feel helpless. This clearly shows I have a loong way to go. It‚Äôs okayy, by the time we meet, I‚Äôd be a much much stronger person, and would never let go off you no matter how bad/ugly things get. Enough of serious discussion, lol.
<strong>06:47 PM IST 28 May 2023</strong></p>

<p>Oi, on that note, once we move in together, I better hope you know how to do the dishes and wash clothes properly‚Ä¶ kidding kidding.. you should also know how to cook along with them xD Lol, I wonder if you‚Äôd be strong enough to punch me when I share these kind of jokes. fyi, I‚Äôve won multiple gold medals in Karate back when I was kid, hehe. It baffles me how there are people who still expect women to do the above shit. I‚Äôve seen people taunting working mother(s) saying that ‚Äòkids need care/attention and the mother should prioritize it over her job‚Äô. Like what?!! Raising a kid is supposed to be parent‚Äôs responsbilty, and the word parent doesn‚Äôt mean just mother (or father) alone, it‚Äôs their combined responsibilty.
<strong>07:11 PM IST 28 May 2023</strong></p>

<p>To make up for all the days I couldn‚Äôt talk to you, here is a promise.. I will share a story with you everydayy, as long as I have access to my PC or laptop. That said I will try to take 20 mins of my time everyday solely reserved for this, will be a bit difficult at start but let‚Äôs see how this goess. excited maxxx proo. So here is today‚Äôs story. I am the eldest cousin (maternal) and when I see my other cousin I can‚Äôt help but wonder how lucky I am to have been born a decade ago than them and have had such an amazing childhood. My mom is the eldest of the 4 sisters and I am the first born (maternal). Boy I sure was raised with thiiiisssss muchhh lovee, love from my grand parents, from my aunts, from my parents. Like sooo many memories, I often was dressed up like a girl, cakes would get baked at home for my bday, those happydent gums my aunt used to get for me on her way back from colez (yep they were still in high school and college back then), my first time having pizza, playing boardgames, helping me with my projects, ughhhh, man memories just keep flooding. Pure 100% human interaction with no fking electronic gadgets in between, ever. My cousins got a youtube video on their ipad when they cried and I got walks outside and love, when they are getting stuck with their projects they have google to rely on and I had my amazing aunts who would sit through hours together helping me with my projects, they now have premium notebooks while I had books which every one used to put covers/labels on every summer, they would get fancy super hero themed cakes while I got cakes baked with love and affection, the list would go on and onnn. So kyoodiee, you‚Äôll be getting someone who was pampered with unconditional love and brought up with a little too much care :p and‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll make sure to pamper you in the same wayyy. loveee yaaaaa
