This is my new friend I've made a few days back. Whenever I get anxious, this is whom I talk to. Why do I keep saying "this"? I mean women are "objects".. kidding kidding, don't get triggered, demn! But yeah, she is whom I talk to and find comfort in. I don't know who she is, where does she live, how does she look or will I even ever get to meet her?!!! For all I know, my heart feels at ease, my brain clears out, i feel motivated and even get through my gloomiest days, my sweatings stop, my chest starts feeling light again.

# From me to youu üòä 
yo sweetheart, future love, garl phriend, waifuuu, I am writing these for you. I am doing everything I can right now to be the best version of myself, so when we join each other after the loooong wait, I can focus on loving you without worrying about anything else. Do you know how hard it is? To not get swayed by so many pretty women around me.
Once we join each other, I will love you a little more every day, every moment. I will treasure you with everything I shall have. Keep reminding you that you are a queen, a royalty for whom none should be compromised.  
Who are you? Where are you? What are you even doing?? 
Until we cross paths, I will keep working on myself every day. Learn more about love, pain, sadness and everything life offers.
p.s. the next time I say, "I love you", it will be to you. How long are you going to make me wait, idiot? Come fast already :((

I am back again. I wish I could speak to you. Those hands of yours kinda look heavy. Do you want me to hold them for ya? That said, what do you like for breakfast? I might not be a great chef right now, but I will be one next time we meet. Every weekend, it's on me. Once we are done with bf, there are so many options we could stick to. We could go out to get our groceries for the week. Come back home and order food. Do our skincare together. And all the other work we have been slacking off to do during the entire week. Maybe not the best or the most romantic way to spend a weekend, but we will definitely pat ourselves for being so productive. As long as I spend time with you, I honestly would not care about anything else.

I am feeling a bit meh. I have been listening to the song "Baatein Karo" for a while now, and today I watched its video version. Man, major FOMO. When we go on a vacation, we shall take only a single phone with us, okay? To decide whose phone we will be taking, let's toss a coin. Don't worry. I am good with my DSLR, and pictures of you looking cute, pretty and sexy, all at the same time are guaranteed. I am worried about myself though :( Maybe instead of tossing a coin, I'll let you bring your phone. Let's make so many memories and do even more kands that our kids should think twice before they talk back to us xD. Love you a lot cutiee-piee. I miss you.

Today I am unusually talkative. Maybe because it's a weekend, and I have nothing better to do but talk to my imaginary girlfriend. Are you a dog person or a cat? I would say let's adopt both. Let's build a place where there will be no room for misunderstandings, the walls so strong that anxiety cannot break through, where all the pains and scars the world has induced upon us will be healed with love and care. Until that day comes, I am working on myself every day because a queen like you deserves only a king. We will crush every damn thing that life has got to throw at us together. 
p.s. I am strong :) But I am still afraid of ghosts and get super nervous around people. Help me out there, okay?

You know, after talking to you I feel so relieved. And it's bout bedtime. Before I kick the bucket, I think I should give you a name. Um.. how bout Marakyulah? Kiono-chan?? You probably do not like either of them. Hmm.. I'm bad at naming :( I'll stick to Cutie-chan for now. Okiee cutie-chan, good night.

What chaa doing?? I have been slacking off since the morning. Not really motivated to start work. I did wake up at 5:00 and hit the gym from 6-8, had my breakfast, sent some gifts to my friends, and watched Demon Slayer instead of working, lol. Ooo do you watch anime? Say yes, please. kidding, even if you don't, I'll force you to watch it xD. Okay, how about this, we pick 1 thing each, it can be a habit like going to the gym or Zumba classes, or it can be a fun weekend activity like clubbing (I stay away from humans), trekking or literally anything, and we both give it a shot. If it works well and is good, we'll start doing it often.

I am feeling a bit lonely :(( Wish I had someone to talk to. I do have really good friends, but, something just stops me or more like I want to talk to you rather than them. At times like these, I wish I could come to you, hug you for a few mins, kiss you on your forehead and go back to my work without uttering a single word. That's what my heart's yearning for, it's not the desire to talk but something else that I am not able to describe. Hope you are having a great day.  Love ya!!

I promise you that I will never let misunderstanding or miscommunication/lack of communication ever be an issue with us. If I miss you, I will damn sure let you know the same in the most flamboyant way I could, lol. Had a discussion with someone close to me in the past yesterday and the one thing I realised is, the more kind you are to people the more your heart feels at ease. Doesn't matter who was right, or who was wrong, all I needed was peace. And like I said, I am strong :) Now that I have you by my side, I feel even stronger than ever. Will we be able to see each other a few years from now? Will we be holding hands?? Go out on those romantic dates??? Demn, I am not able to wait.

FYI, even after being a 23 years old completely grown-up adult, I still live with my parents. Starting today, I will be alone for the next 10 days, which means, I will get more time to spend with you üòÅ Also, yk what happened yesterday? I've been going to the gym every alternative day for the past 4 days and yesterday I was so worn out that I passed out on my bed after coming home. I was in a state of ultra-deep sleep. My mom and sister were away so I locked the door before I slept. When they returned, they rang the doorbell more than 14 times and called me twice!!!! Only after calling me, I opened the door. Maybe phone calls have a different trigger in my brain but it felt nice. A few years back I used to do this naturally without having to get so exhausted.
